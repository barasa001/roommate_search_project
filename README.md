Background Information:
ALU students are always on the move. This is in line with our mantra which has always been “...the world is your campus, leverage it…” The new learning model has made this easier such that studies can be done in any part of the world. This however, poses one major challenge, cohabitation. As students keep on moving, they often find themselves having to look for new roommates. This has not been easy and no month passes by without seeing a message or hearing form our friends, that they are looking for housemates. For those who are lucky to find roommates, some of them are not satisfied with the selection that they made. As a result of this, we had to think of a way that can alleviate this problem.
Problem Statement:
Using technology to make cohabitation easier by providing a platform where people can search for their preferred roommates and get matched with individuals that they are comfortable with, thus saving their time and efforts.
Proposed Solution
Our idea is to create a website where people can search for roommates. Our idea is unique such that we want to make it personalized and detailed such that one is able to get as much information as they need before making their choice.
The Solution is similar to dating apps like Tinder and Bumble where people can select matches based off of their Bios, Location and Age there's also with a chat option to communicate with matches so as to aid in better decision making and experience overall. 
Methodology /Approach:
Introduction
Research was carried out to find out some of the common challenges that our peers were facing. The aim was to come up with a project  aimed at providing solutions for some of these challenges. We carried out interviews and also did an analysis on some of the issues that had been raised several times among our peer circles and platforms such as social media groups. The data that was collected from the interview was then analyzed, tabulated the results, organized in the order of the number of mentions, before selecting the one that had been raised by most people.

Data Collection
We conducted interviews with our classmates and friends. The interviews were random and most of them were done via text messages. We also went over past conversations and messages in the direct messages and group messages. We created a table of entries for the data input. The interviews were carried out over a period of three days. From the results, we ranked the raised issues from the most mentioned to the least mentioned. We then selected the most mentioned.

Data Analysis
The housemate search challenge which had been raised by most of the students was the final idea that we decided to work on . We discussed some of the solutions for the problem. Since most people have access to digital devices, a website would be an ideal solution. This would enable people to easily search for other people who are looking for someone to cohabitate with.

Scope Of The Work Document












Introduction:
Our roommate Finder application is a web app focusing on aiding mainly university students trying to help cover the costs of accommodation, the application will function in similar ways to the typical dating app.

Relevance:
Helping House hunters easily get to know the people they might share a house in.
Ensuring travelers and foreigners easily access affordable accommodation before getting here.
Objectives:
The primary goal is to create an environment where all parties respect each other, and feel comfortable living with one another. This process begins with a thorough vetting process. Next, potential renters are asked to provide details related to their lifestyle, such as their hobbies, occupation and sleep schedule. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the lifestyle of one housemate does not disrupt the other.
Overall, the objective of a housemate matcher is to create a living situation that is both successful and comfortable for all parties. With a comprehensive vetting process and open communication, housemates can be sure to find an appropriate and compatible match who shares their same lifestyle and expectations.
App functionality is also another important factor we took into consideration as most users would prefer to use a properly functioning app with a good user interface.
Evaluation of results:
80% of the people we interviewed complained about the difficulty of finding roommates. 75% of these complained about finding incompatible roommates. This shows that, in addition to the difficulty of finding roommates, those who are lucky enough to find them are also faced with the issue of incompatibility because they did not have background information about the people they were going to stay with.

Proposed solution & Implementation Plan:
The solution is to come up with a website that makes it easy for people to find and match with roommates. This makes it easy by reducing the struggle of having to move from one whatsapp group to another or one place to another asking people if they are open to cohabitation. 
Our implementation plan is to ensure the website has the required features. This will be done using python for the backend, Javascript for the frontend.

Solution Design:
The website has the following features:
Profile - One is able to read the profile before deciding whether to match or not. The profile also contains the contact details. In this case we use emails because mobile contacts are quite sensitive.
Swipe feature-the swipe left,right feature is similar to the tinder swipe feature where one can reject or try to match with profiles created by other users.
Chat Feature- The feature is there to enable users to get to know each other to get to know one another better after all they will be sharing a house.
Login/SignUp feature
